<h1>Proxy Services</h1>

<p>A proxy service acts as a service hosted in WSO2 ESB, and typically
    fronts an existing service endpoint. A proxy service can be created and
    exposed on a different transport, schema, WSDL, or QoS (such as WS-Security,
    WS-Reliable Messaging) other than the real service. It can mediate the
    messages before they are delivered to the actual endpoint, and the responses
    before they reach the client.</p>

<p>Clients can send requests for proxy services directly to the ESB, as the
    client sees it as a service hosted on WSO2 ESB. For example it can perform the
    <code>?wsdl</code> function and view the WSDL of the virtual proxy service.
    In the ESB configuration, such requests can be handled anyway you like. You
    can process the message and send it to the actual service, probably running
    on a different computer, but it is not necessary to always send the message
    to the actual service. You can list a combination of tasks to be performed on
    the messages received for the proxy service, and terminate the flow or send a
    message back to the client even without sending it to the actual service. </p>


<h2>Adding a Proxy Service</h2>
<p>
    From the left navigation menu, select <strong>Proxy Service</strong> under
    Manage > Services > Add. This will take you to the <strong>Create Proxy
    Service from Template</strong> page.
</p>
<div class="image">

    <p>Figure 1: Select Proxy Service Template</p>
</div>
<p>
    Select a template that suits your mediation requirements. If you are looking
    to create an advanced proxy service or if none of the available templates
    matches your requirements, select the <strong><a href="custom-proxy.html">Custom Proxy</a>
    </strong> option at the end of the templates list. This will launch the proxy
    service creation wizard which enables you to customize all aspects of the proxy
    service including the sequences, endpoints, transport settings, WSDL options and
    other QoS settings.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Create Proxy Service from Template</strong> page provides you the
    following set of built-in templates for creating and setting up proxy services
    easily and quickly.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pass Through Proxy</li>
    <li>Secure Proxy</li>
    <li>WSDL Based Proxy</li>
    <li>Log and Forward Proxy</li>
    <li>Transformer Proxy</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For an example if you wish to expose an existing service with WS-Security you can
    choose the <strong>Secure Proxy</strong> option to create a proxy service with
    WS-Security enabled with a specified security policy. If you are implementing a
    scenario where an existing service is exposed over a different schema (message format)
    you can make use of the <strong>Transformer Proxy</strong> option to easily setup
    a proxy service which can transform requests and responses based on specified XSLT
    configurations.
</p>
<div class="image">
    <img  alt="transformer proxy" src="images/transformer.png"/>

    <p>Figure 2: Transformer Proxy Template</p>
</div>
<p>
    Each template will show a limited set of controls which allows the user to easily
    setup a proxy service. On successfully creating a proxy service the user will be
    directed to the <strong>Deployed Services</strong> page.
