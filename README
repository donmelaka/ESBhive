Run maven with an extra parameter to automaitcally copy the jar to the dropins directory. On my machine the command is
mvn -o clean install -DdropinsDir=/home/pubudu/L4S1/project/wso2esb-3.0.1/repository/components/dropins

There is a list-consumer-sample project that shows how to consume the node list. To run the consumer start carbon server with the OSGi console enabled. On linux,
sh wso2server.sh -DosgiConsole

After carbon has started, add nodes using the user interface. Then from the OSgi console issue the command "listnodes"
